# Evolution of Power: Analyzing Pokémon Stats Across Generations

## Project Overview
This project explores trends in Pokémon stats across different generations using data analysis techniques. The goal is 
to identify patterns in total stats, typing, and other attributes to determine whether newer generations have higher overall 
stats and thus can signify a trend towards stronger new additions to pokemon with each consecutive generation.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project comes from `pokemon.csv`, which contains the following columns:
- `number`: National Pokédex number
- `name`: Pokémon name
- `type1`, `type2`: Primary and secondary typing
- `total`: Sum of all base stats
- `hp`, `attack`, `defense`, `sp_attack`, `sp_defense`, `speed`: Individual base stats
- `generation`: The generation in which the Pokémon was introduced
- `legendary`: Boolean flag indicating if a Pokémon is legendary

## Objectives
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values and ensuring consistency in typing and stat distributions.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing trends in base stats, type distributions, and generational differences.
- **Hypothesis Testing & Statistical Analysis**: Investigating whether older generations have higher overall stats.
- **Insights & Conclusions**: Deriving meaningful conclusions about stat distributions and power creep in the franchise.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Python**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive analysis and visualization
- **Git & GitHub**: Version control and project collaboration

## Key Findings
- Certain generations exhibit higher average stats, with legendary Pokémon skewing the data.
- Specific typings (e.g., Dragon, Psychic) tend to have higher base stats on average.
- Power creep is evident in later generations, with some increases in overall stats.
